# recommendations should be simple - they either exist or they dont.  The user controller
# handles the logic behind displaying the recommendation.  All that needs to be done here
# is handling the creation of recommendations and maybe the logic behind de-recommending
# if you decide you don't want to include your recommendation.  Either way, the logic
# will be handled on the profile.
