<div class="login_warning">
  This is a work in progress, especially the styling!  Over the next few months I hope to add full Facebook integration, an efficient search engine, and features such as badges and your own personal tamogatchi-esque Endorsesaurus.  To experience the site to its fullest it's best to log in with an already seeded profile.  The email you should use is <u>"guest@aol.com"</u> and the password you should use is <u>"password"</u>.  I've focused more on functionality than appearance so it should be a smooth user experience but if for any reason any links are broken or you run into a bug please email me at endorsesaurus@gmail.com and I'll fix it ASAP.

  <h1 class="text_center">Welcome to Endorsesaurus!</h2>

    <h2 class="text_center">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Endorsesaurus solves a simple dilemma: What should I watch next?  Endorsesaurus provides a forum for individuals to give and receive recommendations to and from their friends.  These recommendations are used to automagically create an ordered list of what you should watch next.  No more "users also liked" or "users also bought" - these are recommendations provided to you by the people who know you best, not a robot!  Endorsesaurus points system means that the more recommendations that are liked by your friends, the more your recommendations have weight and the higher your recommendations will be bumped on their list.

    <h2 class="text_center">Points</h2>
    <p>
      Points determine how much your recommendation weighs!  The more points you have, the more your recommendation will count when you recommend media to your friends.  There are two ways to earn points and one way to lose points.  The first way to earn points is if someone likes your recommendation.  You will receive points equal to every half hour of media that they have consumed.  The second way to earn points is to watch the media your friends have recommended.  Your opinion of the media does not affect whether you receive points - you will receive points for participating in the system.  Finally, you will lose points if a user dislikes your recommendation.  This should be a rare occurance - be thoughtful with your recommendations!
