Here's how it works:

Endorsesaurus solves the age old question: What should I watch next?  Endorsesaurus provides a forum for individuals to give and receive recommendations to and from their friends.  These recommendations are used to automagically create an ordered list of what you should watch next.  No more "users also liked" or "users also bought" - these are recommendations provided to you by the people who know you best, not a robot!  Endorsesaurus points system means that the more recommendations that are liked by your friends, the more your recommendations have weight and the higher your recommendations will be bumped on their list.

Points - Points determine how much your recommendation weighs!  The more points you have, the more your recommendation will count when you recommend media to your friends.  There are two ways to earn points and one way to lose points.  The first way to earn points is if someone likes your recommendation.  You will receive points equal to every half hour of media that they have consumed.  The second way to earn points is to watch the media your friends have recommended.  Your opinion of the media does not affect whether you receive points - you will receive points for participating in the system.  Finally, you will lose points if a user dislikes your recommendation.  This should be a rare occurance - be thoughtful with your recommendations!
